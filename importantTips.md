Document (DOM) is an already determinated specific interface from typescript that extends all elements within the document whole object. It also detects so it can use methods.

lib.dom.d.ts has all the references to use these types when needed to manipulate DOM within typescript.

If you want to disable the default lib that inclues DOM types, check lib property.

Files ending in .d.ts are type declaration types.
